				<h3>Multi-dwelling units</h3>

				<p>

					You invest a lot to provide a great living experience in your multi-dwelling units (MDUs). Whether it’s student or military housing, luxury apartment complexes, senior living or other properties, your residents expect more. They no longer see you as just the landlord; they want you to be their network service provider too. That means supporting a huge number of smart devices, demanding video and gaming services, and other high-bandwidth wireless applications. And it means making the network that delivers those services just as reliable as residents’ water, heat and electricity.

				</p>

				<p>

					That’s a lot of technical challenges to overcome. But your residents don’t want to hear about how hard it is to provide great Wi-Fi in places with thousands of devices, large indoor/outdoor coverage areas, and multi-story buildings. All they know is that the property down the street has the best Wi-Fi. Does yours?
